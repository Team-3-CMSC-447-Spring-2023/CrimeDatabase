### **Database White Box Testing for Crime Database**
| Test # | Description | Input Values     | Expected Output | Actual Output | P/F(Pass/Fail) Criteria | Comments |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------|----------|
| 1      | Selecting Data from Database | crime_id = 12 | "crime_id = 12, <br>type_name = 6G, <br>type_Description = LARCENY,<br> longtitude = -76.609948, <br>latitude = 39.354788, <br>weapon_id = 0" | "crime_id = 12, <br>type_name = 6G, <br>type_Description = LARCENY, <br>longtitude = -76.6099, <br>latitude = 39.3548, <br>weapon_id = 0" | P, Actual Output = Expected Output | Floating Point Values were rounded. Floating Point values can only be so precise. Everything else is working correctly. |
| 2      | database.py: dropTables() Function | Not Available. | Return Value = 0,<br>No Tables in the Database. | Return Value = 0,<br>No Tables in the Database. | P, Actual Output = Expected Output | Everything is working correctly as expected because the output was properly generated using an automated test file. |
| 3      | database.py: createTables() Function | Not Available. | Return Value = 0,<br>Tables: weapon, neighborhood, crime_type, crime | Return Value = 0,<br>Tables: weapon, neighborhood, crime_type, crime | P, Actual Output = Expected Output | Everything is working correctly as expected because the output was properly generated using an automated test file. |
| 4      | database.py: insertWeapon(crime_data) Function | Not Available. | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Weapon Table = 11 | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Weapon Table = 11 | P, Actual Output = Expected Output | Everything is working correctly as expected because the output was properly generated using an automated test file. |
| 5      | database.py: insertNeighborhood(crime_data) Function | Not Available. | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Neighborhood Table = 170 | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Neighborhood Table = 170 | P, Actual Output = Expected Output | Everything is working correctly as expected because the output was properly generated using an automated test file. |
| 6      | database.py: insertCrime_type(crime_data) Function | Not Available. | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Crime Type Table = 33 | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Crime Type Table = 33 | P, Actual Output = Expected Output | Everything is working correctly as expected because the output was properly generated using an automated test file. |
| 7      | database.py: insertCrime(crime_data) Function | Not Available. | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Crime Table = 462 | Return Value = 0,<br>Length of Crime Table = 462 | P, Actual Output = Expected Output | Everything is working correctly as expected because the output was generated using an automated test file. |

All tests were able to be performed without issue, for the White Box Testing, we utilized a sub-sample of the      first 500 lines from the "Part_1_Crime_Data.csv" Comma-Separated Values CSV File to ensure quick testing of the  functions. The only tests with values that were not identical was White Box Test #1 where the floating point representation that MySQL Workbench used rounded the value to 4 decimal places.

There were no defects in the code written to build the database structure or to fill it with information from the Excel Microsoft Office Open Extensible Markup Language XML Format Spreadsheet and Comma-Separated Values CSV  Files. We built the `test_database.py` file to automate testing of the individual functions and to provide data out for ease of tests.
